<article>Guide to how children develop speech and language between 12 and 24 months:</article>

<table style="width:100%">
    <tr>

            <p><a href="#">12-18 MONTHS</a></p> 
            12-18 MONTHS
      At this stage, children will start to use language in a more recognizable way. They will also become more sociable.
  Children develop skills at different rates, but by 18 months, usually children will:
      • Enjoy games like peek-a-boo and pat-a-cake and toys that make noise. 
      • Start to understand a few simple words, like ‘drink’, ‘shoe’ and ‘car’. Also simple instructions like 'kiss mommy', 'kick ball' and 'give me'.
      • Point to things when asked, like familiar people and objects such as ‘book’ and ‘car’.
      • Use up to 20 simple words, such as 'cup', 'daddy' and 'dog'. These words may not always be easily recognized by unfamiliar adults.
      • Gesture or point, often with words or sounds to show what they want.
      • Copy lots of things that adults say and gestures that they make.
      • Start to enjoy simple pretend plays, for example pretending to talk on the phone.</th>
      <th>
            <p><a href="#">18-24 MONTHS</a></p> 
            18-24 MONTHS
      At this stage, children try out new things and explore the world around them more actively. They will often choose their own activities and may not always like being told what to do.
      Children develop skills at different rates, but by 2 years, usually children will:
      • Concentrate on activities for longer, like playing with a particular toy.
      • Sit and listen to simple stories with pictures.
      • Understand between 200 and 500 words.
      • Understand more simple questions and instructions. For example, 'where are your shoes?' and 'show me your nose'.
      • Copy sounds and words a lot.
      • Use 50 or more single words. These will also become more recognizable to others.
      • Start to put short sentences together with 2-3 words, such as ‘more juice’ or ‘bye nanny’.
      • Enjoy imaginary plays with their toys, such as feeding a doll.
      • Use a limited number of sounds in their words – often these are p, b, t, d, m and w. Children will also often miss the ends off words at this stage. They can usually be understood about half of the time.</th>
